GeogebraR
=========

Examples on how to link Geogebra and R using OpenCPU.

You can check them on-line at

NOTE: Examples based on the Java applet of Geogebra do not work anymore. Also,
some examples may require additional packages and these will also not work 
on-line (but will do locally once the required pacakges have been installed).
